# DeepPavlov tutorials

## Introduction to DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](00_deeppavlov_intro.ipynb) | [slides](00_deeppavlov_intro.pdf) 

Install the library and understand a simple "Hello World!" Bot written in 7 lines of code. Experiment with basic pattern matching rule-based bot.

## Data preparation in DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](01_deeppavlov_data.ipynb)

Learn how to read and prepare data for trainable components.

## Named Entity Recognition with DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](02_deeppavlov_ner.ipynb) | [slides](02_deeppavlov_ner.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/6HlL87PWxXU)

This tutorial is about building a simple Convolutional Neural Network to solve the CoNLL 2003 Named Entity Recognition task. The library components are used for downloading, preprocessing, batching, and scoring.  

## Task-oriented bot with DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](04_deeppavlov_gobot.ipynb) | [slides](04_deeppavlov_gobot.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/uvH1zB7qahI)

Intro to DeepPavlov configs, an examplory config to build a vocabulary of word tokens. Train 4 task-oriented bots on DSTC2: a basic one, a bot with a database of restaurants, a bot with fasttext embeddings, a bot with attention mechanism over input words.
