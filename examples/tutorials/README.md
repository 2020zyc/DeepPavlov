# DeepPavlov tutorials

## Introduction to DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](00_deeppavlov_intro.ipynb) | [slides](00_deeppavlov_intro.pdf) 

Install the library and understand a simple "Hello World!" Bot written in 7 lines of code. Experiment with basic pattern matching rule-based bot.

## Data preparation in DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](01_deeppavlov_data.ipynb)

Learn how to read and prepare data for trainable components.

## Named Entity Recognition with DeepPavlov

This tutorial is about building a simple Convolutional Neural Network to solve the CoNLL 2003 Named Entity Recognition task. The library components are used for downloading, preprocessing, batching, and scoring.
